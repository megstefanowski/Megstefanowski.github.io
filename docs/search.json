    "text": "This year, I trained and began teaching as an instructor at Studio X Reformer Pilates. Growing up as a competitive gymnast and coaching gymnastics in high school, I fell in love with pilates once I started at UCSB, and picked it up easily due to the mind-body connection I spent to many years developing as a gymnast. I missed the instructional aspect of coaching and I love to help others reached their goals, so I decided to put these passions together and teach the pilates classes I was already atending daily anyways.\n\nSince December 2023, I have been coaching 5-10 classes per week at Studio X, and have loved every moment and grown so much from the experience. Studio X provides a 50 minute, full body, high-intensity but low-impact workout on the XFormer machine. There are so many fun elements to the job, like writing the workouts, curating the perfect high-energy playlists, and of course meeting new people and getting to interact with and support a like-minded community.\nI have noticed significant growth in my confidence, public speaking abilities, and physical strength since starting instructor training. From where I started a few months ago- as a nervous new instructor who lacked confidence- I have learned to truly enjoy each class I teach, and genuinley enjoy helping push people to reach their goals and find their strength.\n\n[Link to StudioX website] (https://www.studioxreformerpilates.com/)"

    "text": "Connecticut\nI grew up in Madison, Connecticut with my 2 sisters, parents, and my dog Archie. I love summers on the Connecticut shoreline but hate the cold winters, which is why I was drawn to sunny Santa Barbara! At home, I love to walk by dog along the beach and on hiking trails, get together with childhood friends, and watch sports with my family (Go Giants!)\n\n\n\nIsla Vista, CA\n At UCSB, I live in a house with 18 girls on Del Playa. Despite being in a permanent state of chaos, I love living with so many of my closest friends and am eternally grateful to be able to look out my window every day and see the beautiful Pacific Ocean right in Isla Vista.\nI love spending time with my housemates, and you’ll most often catch us surfing, inviting friends over for sunsets and cornhole on our deck, and gathering together in matching dino pj’s every Monday night to try and squeeze us all on the couch to watch “The Bachelor.”"
