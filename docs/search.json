We discuss California’s ambitions to expand its renewable energy sector and propose a series of floating offshore platforms that not only align with these energy goals but also prioritize the protection of the proposed sacred Chumash marine sanctuary and minimize impact on the surrounding marine life"

    "text": "Essay: The Anthropocene Misunderstood\n\nEnvironmental Studies 188\n (Image credit: Physics.com)\nThe Anthropocene\nThis essay discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the meaning of the term ‘Anthropocene.’ I explain why so many popular interpretations get it wrong and why I find Clive Hamilton’s definition the most compelling. My argument highlights the nuances often overlooked in mainstream discussions and underscores the importance of a more thoughtful approach to defining this era."

    "text": "This year, I began my teaching as an instructor at Studio X Reformer Pilates. Having grown up as a competitive gymnast and later coaching gymnastics in high school, I fell in love with pilates when I came to UCSB and tried out Studio X. The mind-body connection I spent years developing as a gymnast made the transition to pilates seamless. I missed the instructional role I had as a coach and I love to help others achieve their fitness goals, so it was the perfect fit. Combining these passions, I decided to train and eventually teach pilates classes, which I was already attending and enjoying daily. \nSince December 2023, I have been coaching 5-10 classes per week at Studio X, and have loved every moment and grown so much from the experience. Studio X provides a 50 minute, full body, high-intensity but low-impact workout on the XFormer machine. There are so many fun elements to the job, including writing the routines, curating the perfect high-energy playlists, and most importantly meeting new people and supporting and supporting a like-minded community.\nSince beginning my instructor training, I have noticed significant growth in my confidence, public speaking skills, and physical strength. Just a few months ago, I was a nervous new instructor, unsure of myself. However, I have learned to truly enjoy each class I teach, and I find genuine joy in pushing others to discover their strongest selves.\n\n[Link to StudioX website] (https://www.studioxreformerpilates.com/)"

    "text": "Connecticut\nI grew up in Madison, Connecticut with my 2 sisters, parents, and my dog Archie. I love summers on the Connecticut shoreline but hate the cold winters, which is why I was drawn to sunny Santa Barbara! At home, I love to walk by dog along the beach and on hiking trails, get together with childhood friends, and watch sports with my family (Go Giants!)\n\n\n\nIsla Vista, CA\n At UCSB, I live in a house with 18 girls on Del Playa. Despite being in a permanent state of chaos, I love living with so many of my closest friends and am eternally grateful to be able to look out my window every day and see the beautiful Pacific Ocean right in Isla Vista.\nI love spending time with my housemates, and you’ll most often catch us surfing, inviting friends over for sunsets and cornhole on our deck, and all squeezing on one couch to watch “The Bachelor.”"
