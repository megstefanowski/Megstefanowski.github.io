# Pilates
This year, I trained and started teaching as an instructor at Studio X Reformer Pilates. Growing up as a competitive gymnast and coaching gymnastics in high school, I fell in love with pilates once I started at UCSB, and picked it up easily due to the mind-body connection I spent to many years developing as a gymnast. I missed the instructional aspect of coaching and I love to help others reached their goals, so I decided to put these passions together and teach the pilates classes I was already atending daily anyways. 

Since December 2023, I have been coaching 5-10 classes per week at Studio X, and have loved every moment and grown so much from the experience. Studio X provides a 50 minute, full body, high-intensity but low-impact workout on the XFormer machine. There are so many fun elements to the job, like writing the workouts, curating the perfect high-energy playlists, and of course meeting new people and getting to interact with and support a like-minded community. 

I have noticed significant growth in my confidence, public speaking abilities, and physical strength since starting instructor training. From where I started a few months ago- as a nervous new instructor who lacked confidence- I have learned to truly enjoy each class I teach, and genuinley enjoy helping push people to reach their goals and find their strength.
