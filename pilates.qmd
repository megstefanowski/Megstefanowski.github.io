This year, I began teaching as an instructor at Studio X Reformer Pilates. Having grown up as a competitive gymnast and later coaching gymnastics in high school, I fell in love with pilates when I came to UCSB. The mind-body connection I spent years developing as a gymnast made the transition to pilates seamless. I missed the instructional role of being a coach, enjoy helping others reach their goals, and was taking classes daily anyways. Combining these passions, I decided to train and eventually teach pilates classes.

Since December 2023, I have been coaching 5-10 classes per week at Studio X, and have loved every moment and grown so much from the experience. Studio X provides a 50 minute, full body, high-intensity but low-impact workout on the XFormer machine. There are so many fun elements to the job, including writing the routines, curating the perfect high-energy playlists, and most importantly meeting new people and supporting and supporting a like-minded community. 


Since beginning my instructor training, I have noticed significant growth in my confidence, public speaking skills, and physical strength. Just a few months ago, I was a nervous new instructor, unsure of myself. However, I have learned to truly enjoy each class I teach, and I find genuine joy in pushing others to discover their strongest selves.
