[The Anthropocene](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aPfQPiFG_G48kCIJA3pUYZWmtppHg1eQP_JSXsbIqgM/edit?usp=sharing)
An essay I wrote about the conversation around the meaning of the term Anthropocene- I argue why so many prevalent definitions get it wrong, and why I find Clive Hamilton's the most compelling.
